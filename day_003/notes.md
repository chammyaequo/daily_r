Today, I installed Windows 10 on my Ubuntu's Gnome Boxes because the native installer for RStudio is not working for Ubuntu 25.04. Then installed RStudio for Microsoft Windows.

Then I installed tidyverse packages into RStudio with the following command in RStudio console:
install.packages("tidyverse")
